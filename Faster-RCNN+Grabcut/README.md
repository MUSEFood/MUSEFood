train.py uses Faster-RCNN to train the model.  
demo.py uses trained model to generate bounding box and use Grabcut to segment food item.   
¡¤please put the food image data in the ./data   
¡¤please download vgg16.ckpt and put it in the ./imagenet_weights/  
¡¤the weights of the trained model will be saved in the  ./default/voc_2007_trainval/default  
¡¤the segemented image will be saved in the ./data/demo
