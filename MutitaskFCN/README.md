There are three kinds of FCN model with different deep architecture.  
The preprocessing steps are mutiFCN_arch1, mutiFCN_arch2 and mutiFCN_arch3,  respectively corresponding to the demo steps, mutiFCN_demo_arch1, mutiFCN_demo_arch2 and mutiFCN_demo_arch3.  
* please food image data in ./Data_zoo/MIT_SceneParsing.  
* please put vgg19 in ./Model_zoo.  
* the weights of the trained model will be saved in ./logs.
